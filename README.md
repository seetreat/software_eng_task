# Software Engineer Task

In this repository is a list of 10 large Australian cities, containing the city name, and connection information between the cities are present in the form of a SQL script.

## Your task

Implement a simple web backend with a database. Populate a database of your choice with the cities SQL. Develop a method to find the shortest route to start from a given city, traverse through all the cities once and end up at the starting city. You can expose the functionality to find the shortest route as a RESTful API, which would accept the name of a city and return the list of cities based on the order of visit and the total distance covered in the process.
Please implement your solution in a private repository, and add brendan-whelan-seetreat, indrajit-ghosh-seetreat and lars-mejnertsen-seetreat as collaborators.

## Further information

We don't ask you to spend more than ~2 hours on this. We don't really care if you finish it or not, we are more interested in how you think and communicate. It's totally fine to just tell us what you would have done had you had more time.
We don't care which language/framework you use with one exception: no javascript (sorry!)
We don't care how you solve the problem, but it should be your own implementation - i.e. don't use an existing optimization library.
We aren't looking for test cases, front end, or documentation. However, we would like to be able to verify that we can run your code locally. Therefore, please update the readme with instructions to install and run.
