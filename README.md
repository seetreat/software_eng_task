# software_eng_task

In this repository is a list of 323 large Australian cities, containing the city name, the latitude, and the longitude. This data is stored in an slqlite database and in a *.json (these both contain the exact same data).

**Your task**

Implement a simple web backend with a database. Populate the database with the cities. Develop a method to solve the travelling salesman problem: given a starting city and and end city, find the shortest route between them. 

Please implement your solution in a private repository, and add `brendan-whelan-seetreat`, `indrajit-ghosh-seetreat` and `lars-mejnertsen-seetreat` as collaborators. 

**Further information**

- We don't ask you to spend more than ~2 hours on this. We don't really care if you finish it or not, we are more interested in how you think and communicate. It's totally fine to just tell us what you would have done had you had more time.
- We don't care which language/framework you use with one exception: no javascript (sorry!)
- We don't care how you solve the problem, but it should be your own implementation - i.e. don't use an existing optimization library. 
- We aren't looking for test cases, front end, or documentation. However, we would like to be able to verify that we can  run your code locally. Therefore, please update the readme with instructions to install and run.
