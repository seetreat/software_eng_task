# Software Engineer Task

In this repository is a list of 10 large Australian cities containing the city name and connection information between the cities in the form of a SQL script.

## Your task

- Implement a simple web backend with a database of your choice.
- Populate the database with the cities SQL.
- Develop a method to find the shortest path between any two given cities. 
- Expose the functionality to find the shortest route as a RESTful API, which accepts the name of two cities and return the list of cities based on the order of visit and the total distance covered in the process.

Please implement your solution in a private repository, and add `brendan-whelan-seetreat`, `indrajit-ghosh-seetreat` and `lars-mejnertsen-seetreat` as collaborators.

## Further information

- We don't ask you to spend more than ~2 hours on this. We don't really care if you finish it or not, we are more interested in how you think and communicate. It's totally fine to just tell us what you would have done had you had more time.
- We don't care which language/framework you use with one exception: no javascript (sorry!)
- We don't care how you solve the problem, but it should be your own implementation - i.e. don't use an existing optimization library.
- We aren't looking for test cases, front end, or documentation. However, we would like to be able to verify that we can run your code locally. Therefore, please update the readme with instructions to install and run.
- We're going to be looking more closely at the way you set up the code infrastructure then for algorithmic perfection, although of course both are great!
